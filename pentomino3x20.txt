This file uses only pentominoes. All 12 pentominoes are to be placed into
a 3x20 rectangle. This instance of the tiling problem has only a very few
distinct solutions.  You may wish to test the efficiency of your solution
by reordering the pentominoes in this file.

One possible solution is shown below. I've attempted to make this solution
as easy to read as possible by using the letter names of Solomon W. Golomb
in this diagram.
